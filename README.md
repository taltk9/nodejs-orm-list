#NodeJS ORM

List of some ORM modules for NodeJS. Working with differentes databases... =)

###[Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/)

The Sequelize library provides easy access to MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite or PostgreSQL databases by mapping database entries to objects and vice versa. To put it in a nutshell, it's an ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper). The library is written entirely in JavaScript and can be used in the Node.JS environment.

###[PersistenceJS](https://github.com/coresmart/persistencejs)

Persistence.js is an asynchronous Javascript database mapper library. You can use it in the browser, as well on the server (and you can share data models between them).

###[CaminteJS](http://www.camintejs.com/)

Cross-db ORM for NodeJS. Multi-database ORM: redis, mongodb, mysql, sqlite, postgres, neo4j.
